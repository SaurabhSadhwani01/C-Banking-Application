# C ++ Banking-Application
#Developed an Application Dashboard for a Banking System using C++. This project allowed me to master the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) like Classes, Inheritance, File Handling, etc. 
#The system enforces certain rules provided by the bank, such as maintaining a minimum balance and requiring a complete name for account creation. 
#Users can open various types of accounts, close them at their convenience, and check their balances in real-time. 
#The application aims to mimic a portion of the backend processes used by real-life banks, providing a practical understanding of banking operation
